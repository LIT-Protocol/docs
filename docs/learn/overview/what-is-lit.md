# What is Lit Protocol

## Introduction

Lit Protocol is a decentralized key management and compute network designed to empower builders of applications, wallets, protocols, and AI agents in the Web3 ecosystem.

By combining cutting-edge cryptography, sealed confidential hardware, and peer-to-peer networking, Lit provides developers with powerful tools to enhance security, privacy, and functionality in decentralized applications.

At its core, Lit Protocol offers:

- Decentralized key management systems
- Secure computation environments
- Flexible encryption and access control mechanisms
- Cross-chain messaging and transaction automation
- Data oracle capabilities
- Environments for privacy-preserving AI and Machine Learning

These features enable developers to create innovative solutions that address critical challenges in Web3 development, particularly in areas requiring high levels of security and privacy.

## Key Capabilities and Use Cases

Lit Protocol's versatile architecture supports a wide range of applications across various domains:

### Secure Key Management and User Onboarding

Developers can generate and manage non-custodial keys, enabling seamless user onboarding without relying on centralized custodians. This capability is utilized in projects like [PatchWallet](https://app.patchwallet.com/), [Silk](https://www.silk.sc/), [Collab.Land](https://www.collab.land/), [Tria](https://www.tria.so/), and [Index Network](https://index.network/) to create user-friendly wallet experiences and account abstraction solutions.

### Data Encryption and Access Control

Lit allows for flexible encryption and access management based on blockchain state, token ownership, or other on/off-chain conditions. This feature is leveraged by projects such as [Fox](https://docs.verifymedia.com/publishing/access-control/methods/lit-protocol), [Terminal3](https://www.terminal3.io/), [Streamr](https://streamr.network/), [Cheqd](https://cheqd.io/), [Lens Protocol](https://www.lens.xyz/), and [Gitcoin](https://publicgoods.network/) for secure content sharing and data marketplaces.

### Cross-Chain Interactions and Automation

With Lit Actions, developers can create serverless functions that interact with multiple blockchains, facilitating cross-chain messaging and transaction automation. The [Event Listener](https://developer.litprotocol.com/v3/tools/event-listener), [Yacht Labs SDK](https://github.com/Yacht-Labs/yacht-lit-sdk) demonstrate practical implementations of this capability.

### Data Oracles and Real-World Integration

Lit enables the creation of data oracles that securely fetch off-chain data for use in on-chain applications, bridging the gap between smart contracts and real-world information.

### Environments for Privacy-Preserving AI and Machine Learning

The secure compute environment provided by Lit allows for the execution of AI models in a privacy-preserving and verifiable manner, opening up new possibilities for responsible AI development in the Web3 space.

## Industry Applications

Lit Protocol and its ecosystem partners are driving innovation across various sectors:

### Developer Tooling

Projects like [Alchemy](https://alchemy.com/?ref=spark.litprotocol.com), [Pimlico](https://www.pimlico.io/?ref=spark.litprotocol.com), [Openfort](https://www.openfort.xyz/?ref=spark.litprotocol.com), [Lens Protocol](https://www.lens.xyz/?ref=spark.litprotocol.com), [Orbis](https://useorbis.com/?ref=spark.litprotocol.com), [Spheron](https://spheron.network/?ref=spark.litprotocol.com), and [Snowball](https://www.snowballtools.xyz/?ref=spark.litprotocol.com) leverage Lit's generalized services to provide developers with SDKs that power specific use cases such as account abstraction, private data on Web3 social platforms, token-gated chat, and mobile wallet tooling.
