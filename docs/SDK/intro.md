# Intro to the Lit SDK

The Lit JavaScript SDK provides developers with a framework for implementing Lit functionality into their own applications.

## Get Started with Encryption and Access Control.

You can use the Lit SDK for:

### Encrypting Static Content (images, videos, music, documents, etc)[](https://developer.litprotocol.com/SDK/intro#encrypting-static-content-images-videos-music-documents-etc)

Configure Lit to grant blockchain users a symmetric encryption key when they meet certain conditions on blockchains (e.g owning an NFT, being a member of a DAO) so they can decrypt content that is stored on any decentralized or centralized storage platform.

### Gating Access to Dynamic Content[](https://developer.litprotocol.com/SDK/intro#gate-access-to-dynamic-content)

Configure Lit to grant users a network signed JWT when they meet blockchain based conditions and check the validity of this token with your server.

### Creating Interactive HTML NFTs[](https://developer.litprotocol.com/SDK/intro#creating-interactive-html-nfts)

Create HTML NFTs that contain embedded HTML/JS/CSS that’s only accessible to the owner of the NFT.


## Get started with Programmable Signing and Lit Actions.

The Lit SDK can be used for:

### Conditional Signing

Ask the Lit network to sign a piece of on or off-chain data based on the observance of a pre-specified condition. For example, asking the nodes to sign **only when** a user’s wallet is above a certain balance.

### Fetching Off-chain Data

Use off-chain data in your Lit-enabled applications, eliminating the need for external oracles.

### Executing Code Logic

Ask the Lit nodes to execute a piece of Javascript code and sign the response.
