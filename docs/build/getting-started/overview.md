# Getting Started

To start building with the Lit SDK, we recommend that you first familiarize yourself with Lit Protocol by reading the [Learning Introduction](../../learn/overview/intro.mdx).

## Prerequisites

### An Ethereum Wallet
With Lit Protocol being a blockchain-based protocol, you'll need an Ethereum wallet to interact with the protocol. An Ethereum wallet is widely used within the Lit SDK, but is most importantly used to sign messages to provide identity and ownership, as well as to pay gas fees for transactions.

### Lit tstLPX Tokens
Lit Protocol uses a custom EVM rollup, [Chronicle Yellowstone](../../learn/overview/how-it-works/lit-blockchains/chronicle-yellowstone.md), for Lit's backend infrastructure. To pay for transactions on the rollup, users must use the `tstLPX` token.

If you need `tstLPX` tokens, you can get them at the [faucet](https://chronicle-yellowstone-faucet.getlit.dev/).
