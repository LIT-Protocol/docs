# Understanding Authentication in Lit

Authentication in the Lit Protocol ensures that only authorized users can utilize a Lit network to perform actions such as decrypting content, signing with Programmable Key Pairs (PKPs), and executing Lit Actions. This section explains how authentication works in Lit and covers the fundamental concepts you need to know as a user of the protocol.

## Topics Covered in This Section

### Authentication Signatures

**Authentication Signatures** are cryptographic proofs generated by a wallet (like MetaMask) that verify ownership of blockchain accounts that control Lit Resources.

In the Lit Protocol, Authentication Signatures are primarily used to temporarily delegate specific usage (Lit Abilities) of Lit Resources to a session.

Authentication Signatures are typically only needed at the start of a session or when requesting access to new resources. When generating Session Signatures, the Lit network validates the Authentication Signature and verifies that it has permission to delegate usage of the requested Lit Resources to the session.

For more details, see the [Authentication Signatures guide](./authentication-signatures).

### Sessions

**Sessions** in the Lit Protocol are temporary key pairs that allow users to interact with Lit Resources securely and efficiently without repeatedly signing transactions. After establishing a session, users can make requests to a Lit network to use Lit Resources over a defined time period.

#### Session Signatures

**Session Signatures** are aggregated cryptographic signatures generated by Lit nodes. They authenticate a session by validating that the underlying Authentication Signature authorizes the session to use the requested Lit Resources with specified Abilities.

#### How Session Signatures Work

- **Authentication Signature**: You generate an Authentication Signature using your wallet, proving ownership of the blockchain account that controls the Lit Resources.
- **Session Request**: You specify the Lit Resources, Abilities, and session duration.
- **Node Validation**: Lit nodes independently verify your Authentication Signature and permissions.
- **Signature Aggregation**: Nodes generate signatures, which are combined to form Session Signatures.
- **Session Established**: The Session Signatures are returned to you, enabling you to make requests to a Lit network to use the specified Lit Resources with the specified Abilities.

For more details, see the [Session Signatures guide](./session-sigs).

### Lit Resources and Abilities

**Lit Resources** identify the core Lit assets that can be utilized within the Lit Protocol:

- **Access Control Conditions (ACCs)**: Rules that determine who can decrypt data.
- **Lit Actions**: Serverless functions that run on the Lit network.
- **Programmable Key Pairs (PKPs)**: Distributed key pairs for signing.
- **Capacity Credits**: Credits used to pay for usage of a paid Lit network.

**Abilities** are specific permissions that define what actions can be performed with these resources. When generating a session (Session Signatures), you explicitly specify which resources the session can access, what abilities (permissions) the session has for each resource, and the duration these permissions are valid.

This granular control ensures that sessions operate with the principle of least privilege, only having access to the specific resources and abilities they need.

For more details, see the [Resources and Abilities guide](./resources-and-abilities).
