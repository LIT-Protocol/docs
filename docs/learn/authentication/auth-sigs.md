# Authentication Signatures

Authentication Signatures are a fundamental component of Lit Protocol's security model. They serve as cryptographic proofs that verify ownership of blockchain accounts controlling **Lit Resources**. This guide explains what Authentication Signatures are, and how they work within the Lit Protocol.

## What Are Authentication Signatures?

An Authentication Signature is a digital signature generated by your wallet (e.g. MetaMask) that proves you own a specific blockchain account. This signature is used to authenticate your identity to the Lit network, allowing you to delegate usage of Lit Resources such as Access Control Conditions (ACCs), Programmable Key Pairs (PKPs), Lit Actions, and Capacity Credits to a session.

## How Authentication Signatures Work

1. **Ownership Proof**: By signing a message with your private key, you prove ownership of the corresponding public blockchain address.
2. **Session Signatures Request**: This signed message (Authentication Signature) is sent to the Lit nodes as part of your request to generate **Session Signatures**.
3. **Node Verification**: Each Lit node independently derives the blockchain address from the signed message and confirms that address is authorized to delegate the requested Lit Resources and Abilities to the session.

Once verified, the Lit nodes generate **Session Signatures** for the requested session - This is covered in more detail in the [Session Signatures guide](./session-sigs).

### What Message is Being Signed?

When creating the Authentication Signature, the message that is signed is a [ERC-5573](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5573) message with a specific structure that the Lit nodes parse as part of the verification process. The message can include properties such as:

- `domain`: The domain of the application requesting the Authentication Signature.
- `address`: The blockchain address the Authentication Signature is being generated for.
- `statement`: A statement from the application requesting the Authentication Signature.
- `uri`: The URI of the application requesting the Authentication Signature.
- `version`: The version of the ERC-5573 message.
- `chainId`: The chain ID of the blockchain the Authentication Signature is being generated for.
- `nonce`: A random value used to prevent replay attacks.
- `expirationTime`: The time at which the Authentication Signature expires.

In addition to these properties, there is also the `resources` property which is an array of objects that specify the Lit Resources and Abilities the session is requesting access to. What these object look like is covered in more detail in the [Resources and Abilities guide](./resources-and-abilities).

## Security Considerations

- **Keep Your Private Key Private**: When generating an Authentication Signature, ensure your private key is never exposed to untrusted parties.
- **Message Format**: Always use the standardized message format required by the Lit Protocol.
- **Session Duration**: Limit the duration of your sessions to minimize security risks in case of compromised sessions.
- **Least Privilege**: Only request the minimum Resources and Abilities necessary for your application to function.

## Conclusion

Authentication Signatures are a key component of Lit Protocol's security model. By cryptographically proving ownership of blockchain accounts, you are able to securely delegate Lit Resources and Abilities to sessions.
