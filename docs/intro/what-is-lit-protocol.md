# What is Lit Protocol

:::info
[Habanero Mainnet](network/networks/mainnet) and [Manzano Testnet](network/networks/testnet) are now live. Check out the [docs on migration](network/migration-guide) to learn how you can start building on Habanero and Manzano today. 
:::

Lit is a decentralized key management network and platform for building applications and experiences that leverage [threshold cryptography](../resources/how-it-works.md). With Lit, you can create and control keys and run code for virtually any application that can be made private, immutable, and / or autonomous.

The system builds off of contemporary work in applied cryptography, secure enclaves, and distributed systems to provide the maximum amount of control and privacy to end users, without requiring an extensive technical understanding of key management or public key cryptography. 

Developers can use Lit to build apps with [private data](../sdk/access-control/intro.md), intuitive [wallet onboarding](../sdk/wallets/intro.md) and asset management experiences, and [immutable serverless functions](../sdk/serverless-signing/overview.md) that run based on the rules you set.

Get started with the [Lit SDK](../sdk/installation.md).

Read the Lit [Whitepaper](https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/whitepaper).

## Use Cases

Lit Protocol can be utilized for various web3 applications, including:

- **DeFi**: [Conditional transaction execution](https://spark.litprotocol.com/automated-portfolio-rebalancing-uniswap/), infrastructure for recurring payments, liquid staking solutions, and more.
- **Infrastructure**: [Cross-chain bridges](https://github.com/Yacht-Labs/yacht-lit-sdk), oracles for off-chain data, [privacy-preserving transactions](https://github.com/Curve-Labs/lit-privacy/tree/main/packages/lit-privacy-sdk#readme), and [signers for smart accounts](https://spark.litprotocol.com/account-abstraction-and-mpc/).
- **Sovereign Data**: [Programmable credential issuance](https://spark.litprotocol.com/krebitxlitactions/) and [selective disclosure](https://spark.litprotocol.com/semantic/) for user data.
- **Web3 Social**: [Private data in social apps](https://docs.lens.xyz/docs/gated), [token-gated video streaming](https://github.com/suhailkakar/livepeer-token-gated-vod), decentralized chatbots, and on-chain reputation building.
- **Gaming**: [Seamless onboarding](https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/oauth-pkp-signup-example), condition-based rewards, and [private data in multiplayer games](https://spark.litprotocol.com/lit-and-web3-gaming/).
- **Token Gating for Web2 Apps**: Token-based access control for [Shopify](https://apps.shopify.com/lit-token-access), [Zoom](https://litgateway.com/apps/zoom), [Google Drive](https://litgateway.com/apps/google-drive), and [WordPress](https://litgateway.com/apps/wordpress).
