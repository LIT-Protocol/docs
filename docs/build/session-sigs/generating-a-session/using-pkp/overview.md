# Using a PKP to Generate Session Signatures

:::info
Session Signatures are used by the Lit network to authenticate you and verify your authorization to access requested Lit Resources. They are required when making network requests to sign with a PKP (Programmable Key Pair), decrypt data, and execute Lit Actions.

To learn more about Session Signatures, please go [here](../../../learn/authentication/session-sigs).
:::

In order to use a PKP to generate Session Signatures, you'll need to satisfy one of the Authentication Methods that are permitted for the PKP. These Authentication Methods range from an Authentication Signature generated by an Ethereum wallet to more complex methods such as Google or Discord OAuth, JWTs, or even a custom authentication method using a Lit Action.

The guides in this section will demonstrate how to use various Authentication Methods to generate Session Signatures using a PKP:


- [Authenticating with an Ethereum Wallet](./auth-with-eth-wallet)
  - Useful for circumstances where multiple Ethereum wallets can use the same PKP
- [Authenticating with Google OAuth](./auth-with-google-oauth)
  - Useful for web applications that use Google as an authentication provider
- [Authenticating with Discord OAuth](./auth-with-discord-oauth)
  - Useful for web applications that use Discord as an authentication provider
- [Authenticating with Google JWT](./auth-with-google-jwt)
  - Useful for server-side applications that use Google as an authentication provider
- [Authenticating with a Custom Authentication Method](./auth-with-custom-auth-method)
