 # Grants

The Lit grant program is looking to fund projects that improve developer experience and community development in the web3 ecosystem. We want to support those who are building the infrastructure and applications that will make it easier for people to use and develop Lit-enabled applications.

Get inspired by taking a look at our [Request for Ecosystem Proposals](https://litprotocol.notion.site/Lit-Request-for-Ecosystem-Proposals-ae3f31e7f32c413cbe0b36c2fe53378d) and [Request for Startups](https://spark.litprotocol.com/request-for-startups/).

## [Small Grants](https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/LitGrants/tree/main/small-grants)
Capped at $2,500 USD, small grants are aimed at projects that are limited in scope, in early stages or have a short timeline. These grants are for smaller teams (individual developers, non-profits, and/or researchers).

We are looking for projects that have implemented Lit into a project and are looking to prototype or build additional functionality.

## [Open Grants](https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/LitGrants/tree/main/open-grants)
We're looking for projects that will significantly increase Lit Protocol's adoption and open use new use cases for the project. This will require an in depth review process and feedback from the grants team before acceptance.

Project Grants are targeted toward projects with multiple phases, longer timelines, complex needs and greater financial or operational overhead.
