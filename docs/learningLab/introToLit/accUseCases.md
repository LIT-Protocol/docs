# 4. What can you build with Access Control

With access control, you can introduce private and permissioned data to the open web using decentralized encryption. Use Lit to provision decryption "keys" to users based on on-chain conditions, such as ownership over a specific NFT or membership within a DAO.

Some examples of applications that can (and have) been built harnessing this functionality:

**Web3 Apps with Private Data**

Introduce privacy to decentralized applications. Use Lit to securely store private and permissioned data on the open web. To get started with an integration, use our JavaScript [SDK](https://developer.litprotocol.com/SDK/intro).

Examples:

- [Orbis Club](https://orbis.club/): Enabling “friends-only” content and encrypted messaging.
- [Lens](https://docs.lens.xyz/docs/gated): Permissioned data for web3 social.
- [Streamr](https://blog.streamr.network/streamr-integrates-lit-protocol/): Private data marketplaces.
- [Gather](https://www.gather.town/): Powering private virtual spaces for your team.

**Add Token Gating to Web2 Apps**

Use on-chain credentials to gate access to your favorite web2 applications and data.

- [Zoom](https://litgateway.com/apps/zoom): Token-gated Zoom calls.
- [Google Drive](https://litgateway.com/apps/google-drive): Add access control requirements to your Google Drive files.
- [WordPress](https://litgateway.com/apps/wordpress): Gate access to WordPress sites and pages.
