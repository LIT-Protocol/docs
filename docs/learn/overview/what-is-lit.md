# What is Lit Protocol

Lit Protocol is a decentralized key management and compute network designed to empower builders of applications, wallets, protocols, and AI agents. By leveraging decentralized keys and private, immutable programs, Lit advances digital ownership and control.

The system builds upon contemporary advancements in applied cryptography, confidential computing hardware, and peer-to-peer networking to provide developers with maximum control and privacy.

Developers can use Lit to build applications with [private data](../encryption-access-control/overview), intuitive [onboarding and wallet management](../signing-data/overview), and [private, immutable programs](../lit-actions/overview) that execute based on custom-defined rules.

## Use Cases

Lit Protocol and its ecosystem partners are building the next generation of identity and machine intelligence protocols and applications on the open web. Key areas where Lit is utilized include:

### Developer Tooling

Projects like [Alchemy](https://alchemy.com/?ref=spark.litprotocol.com), [Pimlico](https://www.pimlico.io/?ref=spark.litprotocol.com), [Openfort](https://www.openfort.xyz/?ref=spark.litprotocol.com), [Lens Protocol](https://www.lens.xyz/?ref=spark.litprotocol.com), [Orbis](https://useorbis.com/?ref=spark.litprotocol.com), [Spheron](https://spheron.network/?ref=spark.litprotocol.com), and [Snowball](https://www.snowballtools.xyz/?ref=spark.litprotocol.com) leverage Lit's generalized services to provide developers with SDKs that power specific use cases such as account abstraction, private data on web3 social platforms, token-gated chat, and mobile wallet tooling.

### Data Marketplaces

Protocols like [Cheqd](https://cheqd.io/?ref=spark.litprotocol.com), [KaratDAO](https://karatdao.com/?ref=spark.litprotocol.com), [Index](https://index.network/?ref=spark.litprotocol.com), [DataverseOS](https://dataverse-os.com/?ref=spark.litprotocol.com), and [Streamr](https://streamr.network/?ref=spark.litprotocol.com) use Lit for [encryption](../encryption-access-control/encrypting-data-with-lit) in the commercialization of data, powering trustless marketplaces built on blockchains and the open web.

### Identity

Projects like [Oamo](https://www.oamo.io/?ref=spark.litprotocol.com), [Krebit](https://krebit.id/?ref=spark.litprotocol.com), [Terminal3](https://terminal3.io/?ref=spark.litprotocol.com), [Holonym](https://www.holonym.id/?ref=spark.litprotocol.com), [AlphaCapture](https://alphacapture.xyz/?ref=spark.litprotocol.com), and [Gateway](https://sandbox.mygateway.xyz/?ref=spark.litprotocol.com) use Lit to power the selective disclosure of encrypted data and credentials, giving users control over how their information is accessed, managed, and monetized.

### Content Authenticity and Licensing

[Blockchain Creative Labs](https://www.bcl.xyz/?ref=spark.litprotocol.com) has integrated Lit within their [Verify](https://www.verifymedia.com/?ref=spark.litprotocol.com) platform as a secure signing backend, enabling content to be stored privately and under proper licensing.

### Digital Product NFTs

Teams like [Crossmint](https://crossmint.io/?ref=spark.litprotocol.com), [Molecule](https://www.molecule.xyz/?ref=spark.litprotocol.com), [Alexandria](https://alexandrialabs.xyz/?ref=spark.litprotocol.com), [CharmVerse](https://charmverse.io/?ref=spark.litprotocol.com), and [Anotherblock](https://anotherblock.io/drops/the-jackson-5-big-boy-limited-edition?ref=spark.litprotocol.com) use Lit to meet consumer demand for more creative utility for digital assets, such as unlockable NFTs and selective decryption for managing IP rights.

### User Wallets

Lit is being used as a decentralized key management solution for wallets and onboarding experiences by teams like [Collab.Land](https://www.collab.land/?ref=spark.litprotocol.com), [Infinex](https://twitter.com/infinex_app?ref=spark.litprotocol.com), [Obvious](https://www.obvious.technology/?ref=spark.litprotocol.com), [PatchWallet](https://app.patchwallet.com/?ref=spark.litprotocol.com), [Silk](https://www.silk.sc/?ref=spark.litprotocol.com), [Meteor](https://meteor.computer/?ref=spark.litprotocol.com), and [Burnt](https://xion.burnt.com/?ref=spark.litprotocol.com). These products take the form of wallet applications, account abstraction signers, and embedded wallets on existing platforms like Telegram and Discord.
