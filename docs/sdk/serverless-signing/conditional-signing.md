# Conditional Signing

## Overview
Lit Actions inherit the powerful condition checking that Lit Protocol utilizes for Access Control. This means that you can easily check any on-chain condition inside a Lit Action, which can be useful for generating proofs.

The below example will check if the user has at least 1 Wei on Ethereum, only returning a signature if they do.

## Prerequisites

- Knowlege of [SessionSigs](../authentication/session-sigs/intro)
- Knowledge of how to [generate an AuthSig](../migrations/6.0.0.md#generate-an-authsig)
- Basic understanding of [serverless signing](../serverless-signing/quick-start)

## Complete Code Example
The complete code example is available in the [Lit Developer Guides Code Repository](https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/developer-guides-code/tree/master/conditional-signing). There is both a browser and Node.js implementation of the code.

### Example Lit Action

The below example will check if the user has at least 1 Wei on Ethereum, only returning a signature if they do. It uses the [`checkConditions`](https://actions-docs.litprotocol.com/#checkconditions) function from the [Lit Actions SDK](https://actions-docs.litprotocol.com/). This performs a conditional check on the user's Ethereum balance, checking the balance of the wallet address that signed the Sign-in With Ethereum (EIP-4361)[https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4361] when creating the `AuthSig`, which is passed in as an argument to the Lit Action. The boolean returned will be used to determine whether the wallet will be used to sign `dataToSign` or not. 

:::note
The `toSign` data is required to be an array of 8-bit integers. An example of this is shown below:
```dataToSign: ethers.utils.arrayify(ethers.utils.keccak256([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])),```
:::

```jsx
const litActionCode = `
(async () => {
  try {
    // test an access control condition
    const testResult = await Lit.Actions.checkConditions({
      conditions,
      authSig,
      chain,
    });

    if (!testResult) {
      LitActions.setResponse({ response: "address does not have 1 or more Wei on Ethereum Mainnet" });
      return;
    }

    const sigShare = await LitActions.signEcdsa({
      toSign: dataToSign,
      publicKey,
      sigName: "sig",
    });
  } catch (error) {
    LitActions.setResponse({ response: error.message });
  }
})();
`;
