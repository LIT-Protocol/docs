# Exporting a Wrapped Key

This guide covers the `exportPrivateKey` function from the Wrapped Keys SDK. For an overview of what a Wrapped Key is and what can be done with it, please go [here](./overview.md).

Using the `exportPrivateKey` function, you can export existing Wrapped Keys to decrypt and obtain their underlying private keys. The Wrapped Keys SDK will look up the corresponding encryption metadata (`ciphertext` and `dataToEncryptHash`) for your PKP in Lit's private DynamoDB instance. If found, it well then use your provided PKP Session Signatures to authorize decryption of the private key, and will return it to you in clear text.

Below we will walk through an implementation of `exportPrivateKey`. The full code implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/developer-guides-code/blob/wyatt/wrapped-keys/wrapped-keys/nodejs/src/exportWrappedKey.ts).

## Prerequisites

Before continuing with this guide, you should have an understanding of:

- [Programmable Key Pairs (PKPs)](../../sdk/wallets/quick-start)
- [Session Signatures](../../sdk/authentication/session-sigs/intro)

## `exportPrivateKey`'s Interface

<!-- TODO Update URL once Wrapped Keys PR is merged: https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/js-sdk/pull/513 -->
[Source code](https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/js-sdk/blob/master/packages/wrapped-keys/src/lib/api/export-private-key.ts)

```ts
/** Exports a previously persisted private key from the wrapped keys service for direct use by the caller, along with the keys metadata
 */
export async function exportPrivateKey(
  params: {
    pkpSessionSigs: SessionSigsMap;
    litNodeClient: ILitNodeClient;
  }
): Promise<{
    pkpAddress: string;
    decryptedPrivateKey: string;
    publicKey: string;
    litNetwork: LIT_NETWORKS_KEYS;
    keyType: string;    
}>
```

### Parameters

#### `pkpSessionSigs`

When a Wrapped Key is generated, it's encrypted with the following [Access Control Conditions](../../sdk/access-control/evm/basic-examples):

```ts
[
    {
        contractAddress: '',
        standardContractType: '',
        chain: CHAIN_ETHEREUM,
        method: '',
        parameters: [':userAddress'],
        returnValueTest: {
        comparator: '=',
        value: pkpAddress,
        },
    },
];
```

where `pkpAddress` is the addressed derived from the `pkpSessionSigs`. This restricts the decryption of the Wrapped Key to only those whom can generate valid Authentication Signatures from the PKP which generated the Wrapped Key.

A valid `pkpSessionSigs` object can be obtained using the [getPkpSessionSigs](https://v6-api-doc-lit-js-sdk.vercel.app/classes/lit_node_client_src.LitNodeClientNodeJs.html#getPkpSessionSigs) helper method available on an instance of [LitNodeClient](https://v6-api-doc-lit-js-sdk.vercel.app/classes/lit_node_client_src.LitNodeClient.html). We dive deeper into obtaining a `pkpSessionSigs` using `getPkpSessionSigs` in the [Generating PKP Session Signatures](#generating-pkp-session-signatures) section of this guide.

#### `litNodeClient`

This is an instance of the [LitNodeClient](https://v6-api-doc-lit-js-sdk.vercel.app/classes/lit_node_client_src.LitNodeClient.html) that is connected to a Lit network.

### Return Value

#### `pkpAddress`

This is the Ethereum address for the PKP that is associated with the Wrapped Key i.e. the PKP that created the Session Signatures when the Wrapped Key was imported/generated, and used for encrypting the private key. The address is derived from the provided `pkpSessionSigs`.

#### `decryptedPrivateKey`

:::warning
This return value is the private key **unencrypted** and **clear text**.

Be mindful when and where you're calling this method as to not expose the private key to anyone who should not have direct access to it.
:::

This is the underlying private key for the Wrapped Key that was either imported into the Lit network, or generated by a Wrapped Keys Lit Action.

#### `publicKey`

This is the corresponding public key for the wrapped private key that was either imported into the Lit network, or generated by a Wrapped Keys Lit Action.

#### `litNetwork`

This is the Lit network that the `LitNodeClient` was connected to when the Wrapped Key was created.

#### `keyType`

This is the algorithm used to generate the underlying private key for the Wrapped Key.

## Example Implementation

Now that we know what the `exportPrivateKey` function does, it's parameters, and it's return values, let's now dig into a complete implementation.

The full code implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/developer-guides-code/blob/wyatt/wrapped-keys/wrapped-keys/nodejs/src/exportWrappedKey.ts).

### Installing the Required Dependencies

<Tabs
defaultValue="npm"
values={[
{label: 'npm', value: 'npm'},
{label: 'yarn', value: 'yarn'},
]}>
<TabItem value="npm">

```bash
npm install \
@lit-protocol/auth-helpers \
@lit-protocol/constants \
@lit-protocol/lit-auth-client \
@lit-protocol/lit-node-client \
@lit-protocol/wrapped-keys \
ethers@v5
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="yarn">

```bash
yarn add \
@lit-protocol/auth-helpers \
@lit-protocol/constants \
@lit-protocol/lit-auth-client \
@lit-protocol/lit-node-client \
@lit-protocol/wrapped-keys \
ethers@v5
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Instantiating an Ethers Signer

The `ETHEREUM_PRIVATE_KEY` environment variable is required. The corresponding Ethereum address needs to have ownership of the PKP we will be using to generate the `pkpSessionSigs`. 

```ts
import * as ethers from 'ethers';

const ethersSigner = new ethers.Wallet(
    process.env.ETHEREUM_PRIVATE_KEY,
    new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(
        "https://chain-rpc.litprotocol.com/http"
    )
);
```

### Instantiating a `LitNodeClient`

Here we are instantiating an instance of `LitNodeClient` and connecting it to the `cayenne` Lit network.

```ts
import { LitNodeClient } from "@lit-protocol/lit-node-client";
import { LitNetwork } from "@lit-protocol/constants";

const litNodeClient = new LitNodeClient({
    litNetwork: LitNetwork.Cayenne,
    debug: false,
});
await litNodeClient.connect();
```

### Generating PKP Session Signatures

The `LIT_PKP_PUBLIC_KEY` environment variable is required. This PKP should be owned by the corresponding Ethereum address for the `ETHEREUM_PRIVATE_KEY` environment variable.

The PKP's Ethereum address will be used for the Access Control Conditions used to encrypt the generated private key, and by default, will be the only entity able to authorize decryption of the private key.

:::note
The `expiration` used for the Auth Method **must** be 10 minutes or less to be valid.
:::

:::note
The Auth Method used in this example implementation is signing a Sign in With Ethereum ([EIP-4361](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4361)) message using an Externally Owned Account (EOA), but any Auth Method can be used to authenticate with Lit to get PKP Session Signatures.
:::

```ts
import { EthWalletProvider } from "@lit-protocol/lit-auth-client";
import {
  LitAbility,
  LitActionResource,
  LitPKPResource,
} from "@lit-protocol/auth-helpers";

const pkpSessionSigs = await litNodeClient.getPkpSessionSigs({
    pkpPublicKey: process.env.LIT_PKP_PUBLIC_KEY,
    authMethods: [
        await EthWalletProvider.authenticate({
            signer: ethersSigner,
            litNodeClient,
            expiration: new Date(Date.now() + 1000 * 60 * 10).toISOString(), // 10 minutes
        }),
    ],
    resourceAbilityRequests: [
    {
        resource: new LitActionResource("*"),
        ability: LitAbility.LitActionExecution,
    },
    ],
    expiration: new Date(Date.now() + 1000 * 60 * 10).toISOString(), // 10 minutes
});
```

### Exporting a Wrapped Key

:::warning
The return value from successfully calling `exportPrivateKey` includes the **unencrypted** private key in **clear text**.

Be mindful when and where you're calling this method as to not expose the private key to anyone who should not have direct access to it.
:::

Now that we have all that we need, we can call `exportPrivateKey` to export the underlying private key for the Wrapped Key:

```ts
import { api } from "@lit-protocol/wrapped-keys";

const { exportPrivateKey } = api;

const exportedPrivateKeyResult = await exportPrivateKey({
    pkpSessionSigs,
    litNodeClient,
});
```

### Summary

The full code implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/developer-guides-code/blob/wyatt/wrapped-keys/wrapped-keys/nodejs/src/exportWrappedKey.ts).

After executing the example implementation above, you will have exported the underlying private key for the Wrapped Key associated with the PKP that produced the provided `pkpSessionSigs`.
