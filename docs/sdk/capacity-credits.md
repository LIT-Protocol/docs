# Capacity Credits

:::note
Currently Rate Limiting is only enabled on `Habanero` and `Manzano`.
See [here](../network/networks/testnet.md) for a list of test networks.
See [here](../network/networks/mainnet.md) for a list of mainnet networks.

# Overview

In order to use Lit, you must reserve capacity on the network. This can be done using capacity credits, which allow holders to reserve a configurable number of requests (measured in requests per second) over a fixed length of time (i.e. one week).

For more information on Capacity Credits and network rate limiting see [here](../concepts/capacity-credits-concept)

## **Minting Capacity Credits**

In order to increase your rate limit you'll need to mint an `Capacity Credits NFT`. To do so, you can use our `contract-sdk` to mint the NFT. You can download the `contracts-sdk` from `npm` [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lit-protocol/contracts-sdk)

Youâ€™ll also need some 'testLPX' tokens for minting. These are test tokens that hold no real value and should only be used to pay for usage on Habanero. `testLPX` should only be claimed from the verified faucet, linked [here](https://faucet.litprotocol.com/).


```javascript
const walletWithCapacityCredit = new Wallet("<your private key or mnemonic>");
let contractClient = new LitContracts({
  signer: dAppOwnerWallet,
  network: 'manzano'
});

await contractClient.connect();
// this identifier will be used in delegation requests. 
const { capacityTokenIdStr } = await contractClient.mintCapacityCreditsNFT({
  requestsPerDay: 14400, // 10 request per minute
  daysUntilUTCMidnightExpiration: 2,
});
```

In the above example, we are configuring 2 properties
- `requestsPerDay` - How many requests can be sent in a 24 hour period.
- `daysUntilUTCMidnightExpiration` - The number of days until the nft will expire. expiration will occur at `UTC Midnight` of the day specified.

Once you mint your NFT you will be able to send X many requests per day where X is the number specified in `requestsPerDay`.
Once the `Capacity Credit` is minted the `tokenId` can be used in delegation requests. 


:::note
To use your new Capacity Credits NFT you will have to sign an `Auth Signature` with the the wallet which holds the NFT.
:::

## **Deligating Access to your Capacity Credits NFT**

Usage of your Capacity Credits NFT may be delegated to other wallets. To create a `Capacity Credits NFT delegation` you can do so with the following example
Here we use the `capacityTokenId` we recieved when minting our Capacity Credit.

```javascript
const litNodeClient = new LitNodeClient({
    litNetwork: "habanero",
    checkNodeAttestation: true,
});

await litNodeClient.connect();

const { capacityDelegationAuthSig } =
  await litNodeClient.createCapacityDelegationAuthSig({
    uses: '1',
    dAppOwnerWallet: walletWithCapacityCredit,
    capacityTokenId: capacityTokenIdStr,
    delegateeAddresses: [secondWalletPKPInfo.ethAddress],
  });
```
To delegate your Rate Limit NFT there are 4 properties to configure:

- `uses` - How many times the delegation may be used
- `dAppOwnerWallet` - The owner of the wallet as an `ethers Wallet instance`
- `capacityTokenId` -  The `token identifier` of the Rate Limit NFT
- `delegateeAddresses` - The wallet addresses which will be delegated to


## **Generating Sessions from delegation signature**
To create sesssions from your delegation signature you can use the following example.
Here we are delegating usage of `Capacity Credit` from a wallet which posseses the NFT to another self custody wallet which does not posses `Capacity Credit`.


```javascript
  const litNodeClient = new LitNodeClient({
      litNetwork: "habanero",
      checkNodeAttestation: true,
  });
  
  await litNodeClient.connect();
  const authNeededCallback = async ({ resources, expiration, uri }) => {
    // you can change this resource to anything you would like to specify
    const litResource = new LitActionResource('*');

    const recapObject =
      await litNodeClient.generateSessionCapabilityObjectWithWildcards([
        litResource,
      ]);

    recapObject.addCapabilityForResource(
      litResource,
      LitAbility.LitActionExecution
    );

    const verified = recapObject.verifyCapabilitiesForResource(
      litResource,
      LitAbility.LitActionExecution
    );

    if (!verified) {
      throw new Error('Failed to verify capabilities for resource');
    }

    let siweMessage = new siwe.SiweMessage({
      domain: 'localhost:3000', // change to your domain ex: example.app.com
      address: dAppOwnerWallet_address,
      statement: 'Some custom statement.', // configure to what ever you would like
      uri,
      version: '1',
      chainId: '1',
      expirationTime: expiration,
      resources,
    });

    siweMessage = recapObject.addToSiweMessage(siweMessage);

    const messageToSign = siweMessage.prepareMessage();
    const signature = await dAppOwnerWallet.signMessage(messageToSign);

    const authSig = {
      sig: signature.replace('0x', ''),
      derivedVia: 'web3.eth.personal.sign',
      signedMessage: messageToSign,
      address: dAppOwnerWallet_address,
    };

    return authSig;
  };

  let sessionSigs = await litNodeClient.getSessionSigs({
    expiration: new Date(Date.now() + 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24).toISOString(), // 24 hours
    chain: 'ethereum',
    resourceAbilityRequests: [
      {
        resource: new LitActionResource('*'),
        ability: LitAbility.LitActionExecution,
      },
    ],
    authNeededCallback,
    capacityDelegationAuthSig,
  });
```

In the above example we are configuring a wallet to sign a `session signature` which is delegated access to a `Capacity Credits NFT` which allows another wallet to use the credit for increased network usage.


## **Delegation to a PKP**
To Delegate to a pkp wallet from a wallet which posses `Capacity Credit` we can modify the above example as shown below.
For more information on session signatures and pkps see [here](./authentication/session-sigs/intro.md)

```javascript
  const litNodeClient = new LitNodeClient({
      litNetwork: "habanero",
      checkNodeAttestation: true,
  });
  
    const pkpAuthNeededCallback = async ({
      expiration,
      resources,
      resourceAbilityRequests,
    }) => {
      // -- validate
      if (!expiration) {
        throw new Error('expiration is required');
      }

      if (!resources) {
        throw new Error('resources is required');
      }

      if (!resourceAbilityRequests) {
        throw new Error('resourceAbilityRequests is required');
      }

      const response = await litNodeClient.signSessionKey({
        statement: 'Some custom statement.',
        authMethods: [secondWalletControllerAuthMethod],
        pkpPublicKey: secondWalletPKPInfo.publicKey,
        expiration: expiration,
        resources: resources,
        chainId: 1,

        // optional (this would use normal siwe lib, without it, it would use lit-siwe)
        resourceAbilityRequests: resourceAbilityRequests,
      });

      console.log('response:', response);

      return response.authSig;
  };

  const pkpSessionSigs = await litNodeClient.getSessionSigs({
    pkpPublicKey: secondWalletPKPInfo.publicKey,
    expiration: new Date(Date.now() + 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24).toISOString(), // 24 hours
    chain: 'ethereum',
    resourceAbilityRequests: [
      {
        resource: new LitPKPResource('*'),
        ability: LitAbility.PKPSigning,
      },
    ],
    authNeededCallback: pkpAuthNeededCallback,
    capacityDelegationAuthSig, // here is where we add the delegation to our session request
  });
  
  console.log("generated session with delegation ", pkpSessionSigs);

  const res = await litNodeClient.executeJs({
    sessionSigs: pkpSessionSigs,
    code: `(async () => {
        const sigShare = await LitActions.signEcdsa({
          toSign: dataToSign,
          publicKey,
          sigName: "sig",
        });
      })();`,
    authMethods: [],
    jsParams: {
      dataToSign: ethers.utils.arrayify(
        ethers.utils.keccak256([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
      ),
      publicKey: secondWalletPKPInfo.publicKey,
    },
  });

  console.log("signature result ", res);

```
