# 8. Programmatic Signing Use Cases

### **Lit Actions and Programmable Key Pairs (PKPs)[](https://developer.litprotocol.com/usecases#programmatic-signing-lit-actions-and-pkps)**

Introduce automation and interoperability to the dWeb with Lit Actions and PKPs.

Below you will find some example projects and other potential ideas and use cases. You can check out even more examples [here](https://github.com/LIT-Protocol/awesome/blob/main/README.md#guides-and-examples).

**DeFi Automation**

Use PKPs and Actions to automate your interactions across decentralized finance.

- Condition-based transactions (ex. on-chain limit orders).
- Recurring payments.
- Automated vault applications for seamlessly trading asset bundles.

Example Projects:

- [Sling Protocol](https://github.com/Sling-Protocol/pkp-dex-sdk): An SDK for automating transactions on popular DEXs. Currently supports Uniswap V3 and 1inch.
- [Cask](https://www.cask.fi/): Automated, recurring payments.

**Infrastructure**

Build powerful infrastructure that harnesses the power of Lit!

- Cross-chain bridges.
- Oracles for off-chain data.
- Event listening and condition-based execution.
- Privacy-preserving transactions.
- Decentralized key custodians.

Example Projects:

- [Yacht Labs](https://yachtlabs.io/blog/yacht-lit-swap): Cross-chain atomic swaps with PKPs and Lit Actions
- [Curve Labs](https://github.com/Curve-Labs/lit-privacy/tree/main): SDK for building privacy-preserving interactions on-chain
- [MagicWallet](https://github.com/DustilDawn/Magic): One account, multiple seedless wallets

**Web3 Social**

Social applications that empower users with privacy and true data ownership.

- Credentialing systems for privacy-preserving web3 login.
- User owned social graphs.
- Account abstraction with support for web2 auth methods (i.e. Apple Passkey).
- Decentralized chat bots.
- Verifiable, on-chain reputation building.

Example Projects:

- [Krebit](https://spark.litprotocol.com/krebitxlitactions/): Automated Verifiable Credential issuance.
- [Wallet Abstraction demo](https://spark.litprotocol.com/wallet-abstraction-with-google-oauth/): Using Google oAuth to create a Lit MPC wallet.

**Gaming**

Improve the state of [web3 gaming](https://spark.litprotocol.com/lit-and-web3-gaming/).

- Signing and wallet abstraction for blockchain-based games.
- NPCs!
- Condition-based reward systems and achievements.
- Private data for multiplayer games.
