## Overview

Capacity Credits are the form of payment for usage of the Lit network. They are required when making decryption requests, PKP signing requests, and when executing Lit Actions.

While credits are initially restricted to the account that minted them, you can delegate them to allow other Ethereum addresses to utilize your credits. This is particularly useful when building dApps where you want to cover the usage costs for your users.
