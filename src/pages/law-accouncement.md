### Introducing the Lit Agent Wallet (LAW)! 🚀

We're excited to announce that the Lit Agent Wallet (LAW) is now live! LAW is a powerful toolkit that enables secure web3 capabilities for AI agents through:

- 🔐 **Secure Delegation**: Safely delegate wallet operations to AI agents while maintaining full control
- 🛠️ **Customizable Tools**: Define and manage specific web3 actions your agents can perform
- 📜 **Policy Controls**: Set granular rules and restrictions for how agents interact with web3
