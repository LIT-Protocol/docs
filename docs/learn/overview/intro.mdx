# Welcome to the Lit Protocol Docs

You are viewing the _Learn_ section of the Lit Protocol documentation. The goal of this section is to introduce all of the key concepts associated with Lit and how to use them.

If you're already familiar with Lit and would like to dive straight into your implementation, please visit the [Build section](/build) of the documentation.

## Getting Started with Lit

If you are completely new to Lit, we recommend starting with the [What is Lit Protocol](./what-is-lit) page, followed by the [How Lit Protocol Works](./how-it-works) page. These pages will provide you with a high-level overview of Lit Protocol and what you can do with it.

## Core Concepts

Once you have a high-level overview of Lit Protocol, you can dive into the core concepts. These concepts are the building blocks of Lit Protocol and are prerequisites to building with Lit.

- [The Lit SDK](./lit-sdk/overview) - a collection of libraries that make it easy to interact with Lit Protocol.
- [Authentication](../authentication/overview) - connecting and proving your identity to the Lit Network.
- [Paying for Usage](../pay-for-usage/overview) - how to pay for the resources you use on the Lit Network.

## How You Can Use Lit

After you have a good understanding of the core concepts, you can explore how you can make use of Lit Protocol in your project.

- [Signing Data](../signing-data/overview) - leveraging programmable private key pairs to sign data and/or transactions without exposing the private key.
- [Encryption & Access Control](../encryption-access-control/overview) - using the Lit network to encrypt data with specific conditions that must be met to perform decryption.
- [Decentralized Compute (Lit Actions)](../lit-actions/overview) - using the decentralized Lit network to execute custom serverless functions that can read and write to any HTTP endpoint, blockchain, state machine, or decentralized storage system.
